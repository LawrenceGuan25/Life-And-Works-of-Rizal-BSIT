During the 19th century, particularly in the time of José Rizal, the political condition of the
Philippines was marked by systemic inequality under Spanish colonial rule. For more than three
centuries, Spaniards used religion to justify their malicious actions and maintain control over the
native population. Although Spain promoted Christianity as a religion of equality and moral
governance, colonial authorities did not grant equal political rights to Filipinos. High government
positions were reserved for peninsulares and insulares, while indios and many mestizos were
excluded regardless of their education or competence. Representation in the remained limited, and
reforms were often suppressed, allowing racial discrimination and social hierarchy to dominate the
political system (Agoncillo, 1990).

Furthermore, merit and qualification were secondary to race, wealth, and connections with
powerful friars and colonial officials. The friars exercised significant political influence, often
intervening in civil administration and using religious authority to justify abuses and silence reform
advocates. Filipinos who called for secularization, equal rights, and representation were frequently
labeled as subversive or anti-Spanish. This environment of discrimination and clerical dominance
greatly influenced Rizal’s reformist ideas and writings, which criticized the injustices embedded in
the colonial system (Zaide & Zaide, 1999).
