Because the Galleon Trade ended, the Philippines needed a new commercial purpose. The
economic opportunities created by the Industrial Revolution encouraged Spain to open the Philippine
economy to world commerce in 1834. The Philippines became a supplier of raw materials for
Western industries by utilizing underutilized land for cash-crop agriculture, where crops were grown
primarily for sale rather than local consumption. British, Dutch, and American trading companies
invested large capital in the country for large-scale production of products such as tobacco and
sugar. To facilitate trade, foreign investors relied on locals, including Chinese, mestizos, and wealthy
natives, for land acquisition, labor mobilization, crop transportation, and retail operations (Punzalan,
n.d.).

Chinese immigrants served as middlemen between the provinces, where crops were planted, and the merchant houses of the mestizos in Manila, while rich natives,
called Inquilinos, oversaw production by subleasing large estates from friars and subletting them to indigenous
farmers. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, an artificial sea-level waterway connecting the Mediterranean
Sea to the Red Sea, significantly shortened travel between Europe and the Philippines, reducing shipping time from
several months to just weeks. Along with the construction Suez Canal of steel bridges, improved roads, and safer, faster ships, the canal allowed for more efficient
transport of goods, facilitated the exchange of ideas and technologies, and enabled more intensive
crop production, giving a substantial advantage to commercial enterprises (Punzalan, n.d.)
