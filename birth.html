José Rizal significantly influenced Filipino modernism by advocating Enlightenment ideals
of education, reason, and human rights to combat feudal oppression and colonialism. He emphasized
education as essential for social advancement and used his literary works, such as Noli Me Tangere
and El Filibusterismo, to expose Spanish injustices and foster national identity. Rizal's medical
background promoted scientific thinking, while his reformist views, shaped by experiences abroad,
encouraged a shift towards proactive citizenship in the Philippines (Majul, 1999).

Transportation and infrastructure expanded significantly in the nineteenth century, including
the construction of the Ferrocarril de Manila, streetcar systems, bridges, and improved ports. These
developments increased trade, mobility, and urban activity, particularly in Manila, where traffic,
commerce, and population movement steadily intensified (Agoncillo, 1990)
</p>

<p>During this period, traditional political and social structures, such as monarchy and feudal
systems, were increasingly questioned. Reform-minded Filipinos began advocating for democratic
ideals, civic participation, and greater social responsibility, challenging the culture of passive
acceptance that had long defined colonial society. The expansion of commerce and capitalism
created new opportunities for economic engagement and social mobility, allowing knowledge, merit,
and initiative to play a larger role in determining one’s status. As these ideas spread, Filipinos
gradually started to envision a society where inherited authority was no longer absolute, and where
modern institutions and progressive attitudes could shape the nation’s future.</p>
