During the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines, Spanish blood was highly valued and formed the basis of a rigid racial hierarchy that determined privilege and social status. Spaniards born in Spain (peninsulares) and those of pure Spanish descent born in the colony (insulares) occupied the highest social ranks, while mestizos held an intermediate position.
Indios were native Filipinos with no Spanish ancestry and were placed at the bottom of the social
order, while other native Filipinos could occupy slightly higher positions depending on wealth,
education, or connections. In this caste-like system, having Spanish ancestry granted greater social
privileges, including political influence and educational opportunities; as one’s Spanish blood
diminished, so did one’s status and access to these advantages. Filipinos with any trace of indio
blood were often socially marginalized and excluded from elite circles (Balquin, n.d.).

Moreover, this hierarchical system was reinforced through legal, economic, and cultural policies that further restricted the mobility of those at the lower ranks. Indios were subjected to heavy tributes and forced labor known as polo y servicio, while access to formal education and positions of authority remained largely reserved for Spaniards, Insulares, and wealthy mestizos.
Local native elites, or principalia, sometimes acted as intermediaries to gain favor, yet the majority
of the indigenous population remained economically marginalized and politically powerless. This
entrenched inequality not only limited social advancement but also fueled discontent, laying the
groundwork for growing nationalist sentiments in the 19th century (Dacanay, 2026).
