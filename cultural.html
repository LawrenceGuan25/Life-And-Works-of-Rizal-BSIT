During the Spanish colonial era, the Roman Catholic Church controlled education in the
Philippines. It focused mostly on religious instruction to maintain colonial authority over the
indigenous population (Dacumos, 2013). At first, education was seen as a privilege rather than a
right. Access was influenced by the strict racial and social hierarchy of the time. Spaniards and local
elites benefited the most, while the Indios had limited educational opportunities. However, by the
Ateneo Municipal de Manila mid-19th century, Spain had to reform its education system due to local and global factors. These
included the Industrial Revolution and the spread of liberal and nationalist ideas. A major turning
point came with Queen Isabella II’s Education Decree of 1863. This decree mandated free and
compulsory primary education for boys and girls in every town. It also introduced a more organized
curriculum with secular subjects (Dacumos, 2013).

During this time, Jesuit institutions like the Ateneo Municipal de Manila played a key role in
improving secondary education. They offered a humanistic curriculum that included philosophy,
science, literature, and the promotion of human dignity. Historian Teodoro Agoncillo points out that
although these reforms aimed to create loyal and productive colonial subjects, they unintentionally
gave Filipinos the intellectual and language skills to question Spanish rule. As literacy grew and
exposure to liberal ideas increased, a stronger sense of Filipino national identity started to develop.
In the long run, these educational reforms inspired nationalism and challenged colonial authority.
